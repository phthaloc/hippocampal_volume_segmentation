* Validation Plan

** Intended Use

** Training data
- How was training data collected?
- How was training data labeled?
** Performance of Algorithm
- How was the training performance of the algorithm measured and how is the real-world performance going to be estimated?
** Areas of application
- What data will the algorithm perform well in the real world and what data it might not perform well on?
