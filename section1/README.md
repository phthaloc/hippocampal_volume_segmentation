### Section 1: Curating a dataset of Brain MRIs

You will perform this section in the **Workspace 1**. This workspace has a Python virtual environment called **medai** which is set up with everything that you need to train your ML model. This workspace also has a GPU which will speed up your training process quite significantly.

The data is located in `/data/TrainingSet` directory [here](https://github.com/udacity/nd320-c3-3d-imaging-starter/tree/master/data/TrainingSet).

In the project directory called `section1` you will find a Python Notebook that has a few instructions in it that will help you inspect the dataset, understand the clinical side of the problem a bit better, and get it ready for consumption by your algorithm in **Section 2**. The notebook has 2 types of comments:
- Comments marked with `# TASK: `are tasks, instructions, or questions you **have** to complete.
- Comments not marked are not mandatory but are suggestions, questions, or background that will help you get a better understanding of the subject and apply your newly acquired medical imaging dataset EDA skills.
