### Section 1: Curating a dataset of Brain MRIs

In this section we perform an exploratory data analysis (see file `eda.ipynb`). The goal is to inspect the dataset, understand the clinical side of the problem and get it ready for consumption by the ML algorithm in `section2`.

All important results are illustraded in the file `eda.ipynb`.

The following figure shows a sample image of a right hippocampus with overlayed segmentation:
